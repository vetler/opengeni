# Model and provider architecture

OpenGeni separates the model a user selects from the provider deployment that
serves it. This document is the canonical integration contract for model
definitions, provider credentials, billing attribution, workspace availability,
and per-turn execution identity.

The [provider failure contract map](design/provider-failure-audit-2026-10-01.md)
describes official error contracts, current classifiers, messages, synthetic
fixtures and remaining model/sandbox coverage gaps. It does not certify every
configured endpoint.

The point-in-time decision record and evidence are in
[`design/model-provider-architecture-2026-07-18.md`](design/model-provider-architecture-2026-07-18.md).

## Configuring inference

Turn inference uses two OpenAI-shaped HTTP APIs: **Responses**
(`POST …/responses`) and **Chat Completions** (`POST …/chat/completions`).
Configure `.env` (from `.env.example`) and restart the API and both workers.
OpenGeni does not scrape `GET /models`. Membership is the reviewed catalog
(`OPENGENI_MODEL_CATALOG_SOURCE=code` by default, or the operator singleton in
`database` mode). See [Deployment catalog source and cost policy](#deployment-catalog-source-and-cost-policy).

### Built-in OpenAI or Azure — always Responses

Exactly one built-in provider. `OPENGENI_OPENAI_PROVIDER` is `openai` (default)
or `azure`. In code mode its catalog is `OPENGENI_OPENAI_MODEL` (default
`gpt-6-astra`) and `OPENGENI_OPENAI_ALLOWED_MODELS` (default
`gpt-6-astra,gpt-6-sol,gpt-6-luna`). A custom base URL still speaks
Responses; it does not become Chat Completions.

|            | OpenAI                                                                                        | Azure                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credential | `OPENGENI_OPENAI_API_KEY` (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)                                                  | `OPENGENI_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENGENI_AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN`                                                  |
| URL        | optional `OPENGENI_OPENAI_BASE_URL` (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`); unset is `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `OPENGENI_AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` (`…/openai/v1`), or `OPENGENI_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` + `DEPLOYMENT` + `API_VERSION` |

Hosted GPT image generation is attached only for built-in GPT-5.6 ids on
`https://api.openai.com/v1`. Built-in Responses knobs:
`OPENGENI_OPENAI_RESPONSES_TRANSPORT` (`http` default, or `websocket`),
`OPENGENI_OPENAI_PROVIDER_ITEM_IDS`, `OPENGENI_OPENAI_REASONING_ENCRYPTED_CONTENT`,
`OPENGENI_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED`.

### Extra OpenAI-compatible servers — `OPENGENI_MODEL_PROVIDERS_JSON`

A JSON array of additional providers. The built-in stays. Each entry has one
`baseUrl`, one `api` (`chat` default, or `responses`), and one `wireProfile`
(`openai` default). Set `wireProfile: "azure-openai"` with `api: "responses"`
for a second Azure resource (Azure computer-call normalization). Provider `id`
matches `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` and must not collide with the built-in (`openai` /
`azure`) or another registry provider. List every model; a bare model `id`
already on the built-in allowlist keeps the built-in route.

Operator-writable `kind`:

- `api-key` (default) — `apiKeyEnv` (preferred) or inline `apiKey`. Missing key
  is a boot error.
- `anonymous` — no credential and no `defaultHeaders` / `defaultQuery`.
  Externally metered.

JSON must not declare overlay kinds (`vercel-gateway-managed`,
`vercel-gateway-workspace`, `openrouter-workspace`, `xai-subscription`) or
reserved provider ids (`openai`, `azure`, `codex-subscription`,
`xai-subscription`, `opengeni-gateway`, `workspace-gateway`, `openrouter`,
`workspace-openrouter`). `baseUrl` is origin + path (no userinfo, query,
fragment). Put extra query/headers in `defaultQuery` / `defaultHeaders`;
`Authorization` is SDK-managed. `publicDefaultQueryNames` /
`publicDefaultHeaderNames` mark which of those appear in public definition
digests; credential-like names are refused. Model fields, billing derivation,
and examples are in [Registry configuration](#registry-configuration). In
database catalog mode the host JSON still owns transport and credentials; the
singleton owns membership.

### Customer OpenAI and Azure OpenAI keys

The web console offers **OpenAI** and **Azure OpenAI** in the model step after
organization setup and in **Workspace settings → Models → OpenAI and Azure OpenAI**. OpenAI
asks for an API key, with the model preselected and an optional Change model
control. Azure asks for an API key, resource endpoint
(`https://RESOURCE.openai.azure.com` or its `/openai/v1` URL), and deployment
name. Both use Responses and ordinary function tools; arbitrary proxy endpoints
are refused. Azure endpoint/deployment/API-version configuration remains available
separately for deployment operators.

The web flow sends `verifyModelAccess: true` on connection creation. Before
saving, the API checks the exact provider/model with a short Responses message
(32 output tokens maximum, `store: false`, no tools). Provider usage applies;
this uses no OpenGeni credits. Failed checks do not save a connection and show
safe actionable errors without reflecting upstream response text. Other API
callers can omit the check for offline provisioning. A successful setup check
does not establish ongoing provider health. The connected model is selected in
the current user’s next-chat draft from onboarding and Workspace settings.

These connections are workspace-owned, including in the onboarding Personal
workspace. The existing Connections API encrypts the key at rest and returns
metadata only. Usage is externally billed to that provider account and consumes
no OpenGeni credits. Organization provider inheritance does not apply to these
workspace connections. Replace a key, endpoint, or model by disconnecting and
reconnecting; the new connection has a distinct model ID.

`directModelProvider` metadata declares the provider, model/deployment, and Azure
endpoint. `credentialRole` is `direct_openai` or `direct_azure_openai`. Model IDs
include the exact connection ID and version. The metadata-only workspace catalog
adds a secret-free provider definition; the worker loads only the selected exact
active connection, verifies its definition and access, and overlays its decrypted
key for that turn. Revocation or an identity mismatch fails closed. Missing
customer connections never fall back to deployment credentials. Customer routes
use conservative text/function capabilities; hosted tools and reasoning controls
are not enabled implicitly for an arbitrary Azure deployment name.

Canonical: `packages/contracts/src/direct-model-provider.ts`,
`packages/core/src/domain/direct-model-provider.ts` for the setup check,
`withDirectModelProviders` in `packages/config/src/index.ts`,
`loadDirectModelProviderConnection` in `packages/db/src/index.ts`, and the direct
provider form in `apps/web/src/components/direct-model-provider-connection.tsx`.

### Reviewed overlays — not generic JSON

Workspace BYOK for an arbitrary OpenAI-compatible server is not a registry
switch. Voice input, image, and video use separate provider settings.

### Compatibility

The chosen wire API, SSE streaming, and ordinary function calling are required.
Hosted tools, Codex Apps, and Codex `remote_v2` compaction are not implied.
Non-Codex and Codex-portable sessions compact locally; a session frozen
`remote_v2` admits only Codex models.

## Identity layers

A configured model has four distinct identities:

1. **Product model ID** — stable ID stored on sessions and turns and exposed to
   clients, for example `xai/grok-4.5`.
2. **Alias** — compatibility input accepted at admission, for example
   `grok-4.5`. An alias is canonicalized once and is never sent upstream.
3. **Provider ID** — stable adapter and credential boundary, for example `xai`,
   `openai`, `azure`, or `codex-subscription`.
4. **Upstream model ID** — exact deployment slug sent to the provider, for
   example `grok-4.5`.

`packages/config/src/index.ts` normalizes every built-in and registry entry into
`ConfiguredModel`:

```ts
interface ConfiguredModel {
  schemaVersion: 1;
  id: string;
  aliases: string[];
  label: string;
  providerId: string;
  providerLabel: string;
  deployment: {
    upstreamModelId: string;
    wireApi: "responses" | "chat";
  };
  executionLimits: {
    contextWindowTokens: number | null;
    effectiveContextWindowTokens: number | null;
    autoCompactTokenLimit: number | null;
    toolOutputTruncationTokens: number | null;
  };
  credentialSource:
    | { kind: "deployment"; mechanism: "api_key" | "azure_ad_bearer" | "none" }
    | { kind: "connected_subscription"; provider: "codex" | "xai" }
    | { kind: "workspace_connection"; mechanism: "api_key" }
    | { kind: "organization_connection"; mechanism: "api_key" };
  billing: {
    upstreamPayer: "deployment" | "workspace" | "organization" | "connected_subscription";
    metering: "opengeni_credits" | "external";
  };
  cost: "free" | "credits" | "subscription" | "workspace" | "organization";
  capabilities: ModelCapabilitiesV1;
  pricing?: ModelPricingScheduleV1;
  definitionVersion: `sha256:${string}`;
}
```

The built-in OpenAI or Azure provider remains configured by the existing flat
settings. Additional providers are declared with
`OPENGENI_MODEL_PROVIDERS_JSON`.

## Deployment catalog source and cost policy

Catalog membership, workspace selectability, upstream settlement, and
workspace-facing cost are deliberately independent:

- `OPENGENI_MODEL_CATALOG_SOURCE=code` (default) uses the reviewed code/env
  catalog.
- `OPENGENI_MODEL_CATALOG_SOURCE=database` reads exactly one secret-free
  `deployment_model_catalog` row. Runtime is read-only and fails closed when the
  singleton is absent or invalid.
- Workspace policy, credential readiness, and health observations decide what
  is selectable. Neither source stores an `enabled` flag.
- `OPENGENI_MODEL_COST_POLICY_JSON` maps deployment product IDs to `free` or
  `credits`. Omitted deployment models are `credits`. Connected subscriptions
  and workspace Gateway models remain `subscription` and `workspace`.
- `OPENGENI_MODEL_PRICING_JSON` is separate again. A managed deployment that
  marks a model `credits` must provide a price when no reviewed built-in price
  exists, even if OpenGeni settles that provider through an external account.

Database documents use schema version 1 and contain only reviewed membership
and optional line-safe notes:

Model entries may set `logoUrl`, for example
`"logoUrl": "https://cdn.example.test/model-logo.svg"`. The URL must use HTTPS,
contain no embedded credentials, and fit within 2048 characters. Clients render
it as the maker logo in model menus, the collapsed model picker, and session
headers; failed images fall back to the bundled maker logo or neutral mark.
An explicit billing-scope picker keeps its payment-group branding. Registry,
Gateway, OpenRouter, and Codex catalog entries support this optional display
metadata. Updating it through the database catalog needs no application rebuild
or restart and does not change the model's execution definition version.

The optional `codexModels` array replaces connected Codex membership without
changing its credential broker. Omission preserves built-in defaults; `[]`
removes all Codex models. Each entry requires `id: "codex/<slug>"`, matching
`upstreamModelId: "<slug>"`, and a complete V1 `capabilities` object. Labels,
aliases and context/compaction/tool-output token settings use the registry-model
schema. Credentials, transport URLs, pricing and billing overrides are rejected.
An explicit Codex default must belong to this list when supplied. Update through
the existing version-checked catalog upsert below; subsequent catalog reads and
new-turn admission use that membership, while accepted turn policy remains
frozen. Subscription enablement, credential readiness and workspace policy still
apply. Catalog inclusion does not prove the provider supports a slug.
Removal also makes previously accepted queued/resumed attempts fail their
current-catalog check; this is not a hidden-but-executable retirement list.
To retire only from new selection, keep the exact model definition and set
`retired: true` instead of deleting it. Retired entries are absent from pickers,
`list_models`, and new-turn/child-session admission. A worker may restore only
the exact retired definition referenced by an already persisted accepted-turn
policy, after verifying its executable digest. Retirement itself does not change
that digest. Missing-policy legacy turns are not granted this exception. Live
workspace deny policy, session restrictions, subscription enablement, and broker
credential checks still apply; retirement is not permission to bypass revocation.
Choose an active deployment default before retiring its old entry.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "defaultModel": "gpt-6-astra",
  "builtInModels": ["gpt-6-astra", "gpt-6-sol", "gpt-6-luna"],
  "registryProviders": [],
  "gatewayModels": [],
  "openrouterModels": [],
  "modelNotes": {
    "gpt-6-sol": "Use for difficult implementation work."
  }
}
```

`defaultModel` may name deployment membership or an enabled Codex/SuperGrok
connected-subscription product. Omission retains schema-v1 compatibility by
using the first `builtInModels` entry, but operators should set it explicitly.
Provider-only deployments may set `builtInModels: []`; they must supply an
explicit `defaultModel`. The default must belong to the catalog (or the preserved
connected-subscription fallback), be active, and resolve through an enabled
provider. No dummy built-in model is required. Runtime catalog preflight still
rejects defaults that cannot execute.
The strict document rejects keys, billing, pricing policy, enabled flags,
bands, unknown note IDs, duplicate product IDs, and reserved provider IDs.
Notes are at most 500 characters and cannot contain a newline or `|`.

Migration 0389 is a drained maintenance cutover because it changes the exact
runtime-posture table/grant contract. Stop every API and worker, supply the
complete application-login list through
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`, apply the migration with the
catalog-aware release, and restart only that release in `code` mode. Then
validate and upsert a document that is semantically equivalent to the active
code/env catalog before changing any source flag. Run the command from the
catalog-aware release environment with the exact runtime model provider,
credential, cost-policy, and pricing variables present; the database variables
shown below are additions, not a complete environment:

```bash
OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' \
  OPENGENI_DB_SCHEMA='opengeni' \
  bun run model-catalog:upsert -- --file ./model-catalog.json --expected-version 0
```

Omit `OPENGENI_DB_SCHEMA` for `public`; embedded deployments must set the same
dedicated schema used by migrations and runtime connections.

Before opening its write transaction, the command applies the candidate to the
same database-mode deployment settings and secret bindings used by runtime and
requires the fully resolved catalog to be executable. It therefore rejects
host-provider transport mismatches, missing provider credentials, invalid
defaults, and incompatible cost/pricing policy without changing the singleton.
The upsert increments `version` only when the normalized document changes. It
never writes provider credentials or the separate cost policy. The mandatory
`--expected-version` is a compare-and-swap fence: use `0` only for an absent
singleton, then pass the exact reported version for every later update. A stale
version is rejected without changing the document or version. The operator
transaction has bounded lock and statement timeouts, so another operator cannot
leave the command waiting indefinitely.

Roll every API, control worker, and turn worker to database mode only while the
database document remains equivalent to the code catalog. Verify client config,
an authenticated workspace catalog, the picker, and `list_models` after the
whole fleet converges. Only then add database-only membership. Before removing
a model or changing its executable definition, drain or fence accepted queued
and active turns that still name the old definition; accepted turns fail closed
on definition drift rather than silently switching providers. A maintenance
window that stops all catalog consumers is the simpler alternative.

Sessions whose stored deployment model leaves the catalog keep their history
and frozen turns. A new message that would use the removed model is refused
with 422
`validation_failed` (`model is not available: <id>`) plus
`details: { code: "model_unavailable", modelId }`; retrying the same request
cannot succeed, so clients must choose another model. The web console detects
a deployment model missing from the workspace catalog (connection-owned custom
and subscription models are judged only by that refusal, because a session may
keep a retained definition), says the chat's model is no longer available, and
preselects the resolved default for the next message only. A refused send keeps
the typed message behind Edit message instead of Retry.

Workspace-admin removal of a custom Vercel AI Gateway or OpenRouter slug is a
retirement, not a hard delete. The provider-qualified slug leaves new model
selection immediately, while an already accepted turn or an existing-session
continuation can still resolve its retained definition. Re-adding the same slug
creates a fresh row identity; stale mutations against an older generation
cannot affect the replacement.
Fresh session admission, an explicit follow-up switch from another model, a new
or materially reaccepted scheduled task, automation trigger, or PR-review
repository binding, and a fresh generated-session scheduled occurrence recheck
the active row under the custom-model shared transaction lock in the same commit
that inserts the session, accepts the turn, writes the task/trigger/binding, or
accepts the occurrence. A committed keyed session shell or exact producer
occurrence is detected before active-only catalog validation and reopens its
persisted model only as a retained definition, so the same key can finish
initialization or replay after retirement without reopening fresh-selection
authority.
Retirement takes the exclusive counterpart, so a successful removal cannot be
followed by new work committing from a stale pre-removal catalog snapshot.
Deployment-curated workspace provider products share their provider's public
prefix but have no custom row and bypass this row-admission fence.
Existing-session scheduled tasks and administrative-only task/trigger edits
retain their already accepted model definition. Each workspace may keep 100
active slugs and 1,000 retained generations per provider.
Retirement does not reclaim generation capacity because those rows remain the
execution authority for accepted turns and existing sessions.

Database mode permits cost-policy entries for product IDs that are not yet in
the current singleton so operators can stage cost and pricing before adding
membership. Code mode keeps rejecting unknown cost-policy IDs. Membership and
cost remain separate inputs.

For an authenticated `registryProviders` entry in database mode, predeclare the
same provider ID in `OPENGENI_MODEL_PROVIDERS_JSON` with its deployment-owned
`apiKey` or `apiKeyEnv`. The database entry must exactly match the host-approved
transport identity: provider kind, base URL, and wire API/profile. Database
documents cannot contain default headers/query or their public-name
classifications; the executable provider inherits those complete maps and its
credential only from the host declaration. The database document controls
reviewed model membership and labels only. A mismatch fails closed, preventing
a database document from redirecting a host credential to another endpoint.

## Registry configuration

Each registry provider declares a stable ID, one wire API, one base URL, its
credential location, and one or more model definitions:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "fireworks",
    "label": "Fireworks AI",
    "api": "chat",
    "wireProfile": "openai",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1",
    "apiKeyEnv": "OPENGENI_FIREWORKS_API_KEY",
    "models": [
      {
        "id": "accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p2",
        "label": "GLM 5.2",
        "contextWindowTokens": 1048576,
        "reasoningEffort": true,
        "hostedWebSearch": false
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Registry providers default to `kind: "api-key"`, `api: "chat"`, and
`wireProfile: "openai"`. Set `wireProfile: "azure-openai"` for another Azure
OpenAI resource: it keeps the ordinary OpenAI-compatible Responses transport
while applying Azure's stricter computer-call history normalization and native
Responses tool behavior. Prefer
`apiKeyEnv` to an inline `apiKey`. A provider that intentionally accepts public,
unauthenticated inference must set `kind: "anonymous"`; that kind rejects
`apiKey`, `apiKeyEnv`, and all configured default header/query metadata. This
keeps an operator from attaching an upstream session cookie or another hidden
credential while retaining external-metered billing. Missing a key on an
ordinary `api-key` provider remains a boot error. `defaultQuery` and
`defaultHeaders` are provider request configuration, not model identity aliases,
and are available only to authenticated provider kinds. Provider base URLs must
not contain userinfo, a query, or a fragment.

A registry model may add:

- `upstreamModelId` (defaults to the product `id`);
- `aliases`;
- raw, effective, auto-compaction, and tool-output token limits;
- the full `capabilities` object;
- flat pricing or an input-token-tiered pricing schedule.

Legacy `reasoningEffort` and `hostedWebSearch` booleans remain accepted. When a
full capability record is also present, the legacy booleans must agree with it.

A model whose reasoning capability is not runnable (`reasoningEffort: false`,
the registry default) receives no reasoning effort on the wire. Its turns
still record an accepted effort, but the worker omits it rather than sending
the deployment default, which an upstream may reject (Gemini refuses `xhigh`).
The same holds for custom OpenRouter slugs and customer OpenAI and Azure
OpenAI connections, and the web new-session composer accepts any recorded
effort for such a model instead of requiring its picker placeholder. Set `reasoningEffort: true`
(or a full `capabilities.reasoning` record) to send the session's effort.

Generic registry JSON cannot set `credentialSource` or `billing`. OpenGeni
derives both from the provider kind:

| Provider kind                        | Credential source             | Upstream payer         | Metering         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Built-in or registry API key         | deployment                    | deployment             | OpenGeni credits |
| Anonymous registry route             | deployment, no authentication | deployment             | external         |
| Azure without an API key             | deployment Azure AD bearer    | deployment             | OpenGeni credits |
| Connected Codex subscription         | connected subscription        | connected subscription | external         |
| Connected SuperGrok/xAI subscription | connected subscription        | connected subscription | external         |
| Workspace Vercel AI Gateway          | workspace connection          | workspace              | external         |
| Workspace OpenRouter                 | workspace connection          | workspace              | external         |
| Workspace OpenAI / Azure OpenAI       | workspace connection          | workspace              | external         |
| Organization Vercel AI Gateway      | organization connection       | organization           | external         |
| Organization OpenRouter             | organization connection       | organization           | external         |

`workspace_connection` is a reserved normalized contract. Generic JSON does
not enable workspace BYOK; that requires a separately reviewed encrypted
credential broker.

`organization_connection` is the peer organization-owned broker. Organization
admins connect Vercel AI Gateway or OpenRouter once in Organization settings and
curate explicit custom model slugs. Active products use
`organization-gateway/` or `organization-openrouter/`, are externally billed to
the organization provider account, and inherit into current and future shared
workspaces only. Canonical Personal workspaces remain local. Workspace provider
connections coexist under their existing IDs; no payer rail falls back or
migrates implicitly.

The table describes credential and upstream-settlement identity, not the
workspace-facing price. Deployment models—including anonymous and managed
OpenRouter routes—default to `credits` unless
`OPENGENI_MODEL_COST_POLICY_JSON` marks the exact product ID `free`. The picker
groups all deployment-provided models under OpenGeni, regardless of upstream
provider or settlement. Only explicitly free models receive a Free badge; paid
rows omit repetitive credit labels. Subscription descriptions appear once per
provider group; the Free badge stays explicit, and `list_models` retains the cost.
Workspace/organization connections and connected subscriptions stay separate.

### OpenCode Zen temporary free contributor model

OpenCode Zen currently exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at
`https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`. On September 3, 2026, its public model registry
included `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`, and the model accepted keyless
Responses API calls, SSE streaming, and function calls. OpenCode documents the
free contributor window as temporary, so configure it as an operator-owned
registry entry rather than treating it as a permanent built-in or availability
promise:

Requests go from OpenGeni to OpenCode's `opencode.ai` service; this is not local
inference. Anonymous deployment routes are shown under OpenGeni. To make this
temporary preview free to the workspace, set
`OPENGENI_MODEL_COST_POLICY_JSON='{"opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free":"free"}'`;
external settlement alone does not bypass credits. A free route still emits
ordinary model-call/token telemetry plus a zero-cost audit marker. It remains
subject to the upstream provider's changing
model catalogue, rate limits, retention policy, contributor duration, and terms.
Verify `GET /zen/v1/models` before enabling the route and remove or update the
registry entry when keyless access or the model slug changes. The example keeps
OpenGeni's runnable input capability at its conservative text-only default until
the image path is independently verified end to end.

OpenCode Zen uses the same provider-neutral progressive disclosure as other
ordinary Responses API providers. The first request receives the stable
`tool_search` and `tool_invoke` functions plus OpenGeni's always-visible base
tools and any explicitly eager MCP tools. Deferred MCP and other non-base tool
schemas stay out of the initial prompt; matching definitions are disclosed on
demand, and a valid invocation is rebound to the real authorized tool before
approval, guardrails, execution, and event handling. This needs only ordinary
function calling from Zen—no OpenCode-specific lazy-tool protocol.

OpenCode 1.18.21 also documented a client-side workaround for model responses
whose finish reason is `unknown`: continue the model loop instead of accepting
the response as final. OpenGeni handles the same signal at the generic Chat
Completions adapter boundary. It withholds `response_done`, executes no tool call
from the ambiguous response, and routes the same accepted turn through the
existing fenced recovery path from durable history. This is intentionally
narrower than blindly replaying every interrupted stream; ordinary partial or
outcome-unknown provider operations retain their existing safety classification.

Other Zen models use the same generic registry, but authentication and billing
ownership must stay explicit:

- Add another currently keyless model under the same `kind: "anonymous"`
  provider only after verifying that the exact slug accepts requests with no
  `Authorization` header.
- For deployment-managed paid Zen models, declare a separate `kind: "api-key"`
  provider (it may reuse the same base URL) with `apiKeyEnv` and reviewed model
  pricing/capabilities. The deployment owns the upstream account and OpenGeni
  meters those turns through the ordinary OpenGeni-credit path.
- A workspace member connecting their own OpenCode key/account is not generic
  registry JSON. That requires a reviewed encrypted workspace-connection broker,
  readiness/re-auth UI, and `upstreamPayer: workspace` external billing—the same
  authority boundary used by workspace AI Gateway.

Provider JSON is deliberately a static reviewed catalogue. OpenGeni does not
silently mirror `GET /models` into the picker because a mutable upstream list
does not supply stable product IDs, capability evidence, context limits,
pricing, billing ownership, or definition versions. An operator may use the
endpoint to prepare an update, but the accepted registry remains canonical.

### Opper

[Opper](https://opper.ai) is an EU-hosted AI gateway with one OpenAI-compatible
API and one key for 700+ models from 50+ providers. It needs no overlay: an
ordinary `api-key` registry provider on Chat Completions is enough.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "opper",
    "label": "Opper",
    "api": "chat",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.opper.ai/v3/compat",
    "apiKeyEnv": "OPENGENI_OPPER_API_KEY",
    "models": [
      {
        "id": "opper/claude-sonnet-4-6",
        "upstreamModelId": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
        "label": "Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Opper)",
        "contextWindowTokens": 1000000,
        "reasoningEffort": false,
        "hostedWebSearch": false
      },
      {
        "id": "opper/gemini-3.8-flash",
        "upstreamModelId": "gemini-3.8-flash",
        "label": "Gemini 3.8 Flash (Opper)",
        "contextWindowTokens": 1048576,
        "reasoningEffort": false,
        "hostedWebSearch": false
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Create the key at [platform.opper.ai](https://platform.opper.ai) and set
`OPENGENI_OPPER_API_KEY`. As with any `api-key` registry provider, the
deployment owns the Opper account and these turns are metered as OpenGeni
credits.

The registry entry only declares the transport. To make the models selectable,
add the product IDs (`opper/claude-sonnet-4-6`, `opper/gemini-3.8-flash`) to the
deployment model catalog when its source is `database` (see
[Deployment catalog source and cost policy](#deployment-catalog-source-and-cost-policy)).
These models are `credits` by default and have no reviewed built-in price, so a
managed deployment must also add an `OPENGENI_MODEL_PRICING_JSON` entry for each
product ID (Opper's catalogue lists per-model pricing), or mark them `free` in
`OPENGENI_MODEL_COST_POLICY_JSON`.

A bare upstream ID such as `claude-sonnet-4-6` is a pool: Opper picks the
serving provider per request. A `provider/model` upstream ID such as
`aws/claude-sonnet-4-6-eu` pins one provider and region, for deployments that
need a model processed in the EU. Opper's public catalogue at
`GET https://api.opper.ai/v3/models` lists pool names and context windows for
preparing entries; the registry JSON above stays canonical. The example keeps
reasoning and hosted web search off; enable a capability for a model only after
verifying it end to end through OpenGeni.

## Curated AI Gateway models

`OPENGENI_VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` enables two reviewed OpenGeni-credit
models. They are siblings of the built-in GPT-5.6 family in the OpenGeni picker
rail; the client never receives the Gateway hostname, upstream model slug, or
endpoint provider.

| Product                | Approved provider order      | Supplier input / cache read / cache write / output                                                                             | Conservative retail fallback (+5%)                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 | Baseten → Novita → DeepInfra | Baseten $0.13 / $0.028 / $0.13 / $0.26; Novita $0.14 / $0.028 / $0.14 / $0.28; DeepInfra $0.09 / $0.018 / $0.09 / $0.18 per 1M | $0.147 / $0.0294 / $0.147 / $0.294 per 1M (highest approved route) |
| Kimi K3                | Baseten → Fireworks          | $3 / $0.30 / $3 / $15 per 1M on both routes                                                                                        | $3.15 / $0.315 / $3.15 / $15.75 per 1M                            |

Prices are a reviewed 2026-09-02 snapshot from public Gateway endpoint metadata.
Gateway does not publish a separate cache-write rate for these routes, so the
static fallback prices cache writes at the route's uncached-input rate.
Managed turns normally debit the exact Gateway-reported inference cost for the
provider that actually served the response, plus 5%. The static token rates
above are only a conservative fallback if that response metadata is absent.
Adding or changing a model requires reviewing the provider order, Responses
tool/vision transport, cache reporting, pricing, definition, and tests together.
Kimi's Gateway Responses adapter rejects grouped parallel call/result history.
At the post-serialization fence, OpenGeni pairs only complete call/result batches
by `call_id`. This preserves all fields and parallel execution; it does not
change the model or provider route. Grouped, name-annotated, and Chat Completions
continuations were probed on 2026-08-03; only the paired Responses shape kept
full tool continuity plus Gateway route/cost metadata.

Gemini upstreams (any route whose upstream model id contains `gemini`, for
example Gateway to Vertex) receive a JSON tool-output string as a parsed
`functionResponse.response` object, where Gemini reserves the key `$ref` for
multimodal part references. A request-local projection
(`packages/runtime/src/gemini-function-response.ts`) renames only object keys
that decode to `$ref` to `_$ref` inside valid-JSON function/tool outputs, so a
`tool_search` schema result cannot fail the turn with a 400. Canonical history
is unchanged and the projection is deterministic for prompt caching.

Google's OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint streams tool calls in a
shape the SDK's stream accumulator mishandles, so `OpenGeniChatCompletionsModel`
repairs the completed output from the raw chunks
(`packages/runtime/src/chat-tool-call-stream.ts`):

- Each call arrives whole, in its own chunk, with its own id and no `index`.
  The SDK keys streamed calls by `index`, which would merge parallel calls into
  one call with concatenated names and arguments; they are rebuilt as separate
  calls by id. Indexed (OpenAI-style) streams keep the SDK's items.
- The first call of each step carries `extra_content.google.thought_signature`,
  and Google rejects the next request with a 400 unless that object is
  replayed on the same call. The SDK keeps it for non-streamed replies but
  drops it while streaming, so it is restored to the call's `providerData` by
  call id. Durable history keeps it, and the SDK replays it on that tool call.
  History projected to the Responses or Claude Messages API drops it, because
  only a Chat route can read it.

The same endpoint returns errors as a one-element array (`[{ "error": … }]`).
`ReplayableJsonOpenAI` and the quota retry veto both unwrap exactly that shape
(`providerErrorBody` in `packages/runtime/src/replayable-json-body.ts`), so the
provider message reaches `turn.failed` instead of `400 status code (no body)`
and Gemini quota wording is classified like any other provider's.

Every Gateway request replaces caller routing options with the reviewed provider
list in both `only` and `order`, sends no model fallback list, and disables OpenAI
SDK retries. Gateway may advance only through that ordered allowlist. Unknown
Gateway model slugs fail before network I/O. Keep Gateway account-level rewrite
rules disabled for the managed key because those rules operate outside the
request body.

Both models request Gateway automatic caching. Kimi remains catalogued as
image-capable, so the worker also attaches `view_image` and `computer_*`
screenshot tools. DeepSeek stays text-only. OpenGeni verifies finalized
attachment bytes and checksums, then sends images inline as data URLs through
the standard Responses input surface; it never gives an endpoint provider an
object-store URL.

DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 and Kimi K3 use OpenGeni's provider-neutral lazy-tool
dispatcher on the Responses wire. Their initial tool block contains the stable
ordinary `tool_search` and `tool_invoke` schemas, the always-visible base
runtime tools (`exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `apply_patch`, `view_image`,
`skill_read`, `request_human_input`, `list_models`, and `code_search` / provider `web_search` / `web_fetch` when enabled),
and exact session MCP refs marked
`eager: true`, never the deferred MCP catalogue or Browser/Computer/`generate_image`/
`generate_video`/`get_video_generation_capabilities` schemas. A search result carries only bounded
matching definitions. A valid `tool_invoke` call is renamed to the exact real authorized tool and
bound through `resolveMissingFunctionTool` in that same model response before
normal approval, guardrail, timeout, MCP error, and event handling. Leftover
historical registration items stay out of provider and user-visible history.
Provider history is restored to the original dispatcher call before every later
request—including exact stateless Responses replay, provider changes, lazy-mode
rollback, and compaction input.

A workspace admin can instead connect **Vercel AI Gateway** in workspace Settings.
The key is stored in the encrypted workspace connection table, resolved only in
the worker, and uses the same curated models and exact routes. These turns have
`upstreamPayer: workspace` and `metering: external`, so OpenGeni never debits
credits. Gateway credential create/rotation replay receipts use a
deployment-keyed HMAC and their reserved operation fields are stripped from all
public connection metadata projections. The picker hides this rail until the
connection is active.

Admins may also add one exact Vercel model slug at a time in the same Settings
card. The durable row stores only the workspace, slug, optional label, actor,
and timestamps. Custom IDs are `workspace-gateway/<slug>`; they receive the
reviewed generic text/function-calling Gateway capability envelope and no
provider pin, route order, pricing form, or upstream `/models` discovery.
Custom slugs may be prepared while disconnected, become selectable only after
the workspace Gateway connection is active and policy allows them, and are
available to session, automation, scheduled-task, and goal-continuation policy
resolution through the same workspace-scoped catalog overlay.

## OpenRouter rails

`OPENGENI_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` enables a deployment-managed OpenRouter provider
at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. It uses the generic OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions dispatcher, public `X-Title` / optional `HTTP-Referer` metadata, and
deployment-owned credentials. Its provider ID is `openrouter`, and product IDs
use `openrouter/<upstream>`. This deployment rail is independent of any
workspace-owned OpenRouter connection.

For explicit `anthropic/…` Chat targets on any OpenRouter rail, the request
adapter moves unsigned historical reasoning into labeled assistant text instead
of sending it as native thinking. It preserves signed text and encrypted
reasoning details and leaves stored history unchanged. This also handles older
non-streamed replies whose reasoning was nested inside text metadata. Other
Chat targets retain their native reasoning fields.

The reviewed code catalog currently ships one v1 starter:

```text
openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free
```

On August 27, 2026, OpenRouter advertised that slug with a 262,144-token context
window, a 235,929-token completion ceiling, text input/output, function tools,
tool choice, structured outputs, and reasoning controls. A live forced-function
probe completed with `finish_reason=tool_calls`. OpenGeni therefore marks
function calling and structured output runnable. On September 8, 2026, OpenRouter
`GET /api/v1/models` explicitly advertised reasoning efforts `low` and `medium`,
with `medium` as default. Both are runnable; the Chat Completions adapter sends
the selected value as `reasoning_effort`. Higher levels are not exposed.

OpenRouter membership is curated and production never mirrors `GET /models`.
The v1 database schema accepts reviewed `:free` slugs only; a key does not make
every upstream model visible, and workspace policy may hide the starter. The
provider settles through the deployment's OpenRouter account and appears in the
OpenGeni picker group, while `OPENGENI_MODEL_COST_POLICY_JSON` independently
decides whether the workspace sees `free` or `credits`. The shipped default is
`free`. If an operator changes it to `credits`, managed billing also requires a
separate `OPENGENI_MODEL_PRICING_JSON` entry.

The generic dispatch path can carry future reviewed deployment OpenRouter chat
models, but paid deployment-managed OpenRouter membership is intentionally not
admitted by the v1 deployment-catalog contract. For example, GLM 5.3 Flash was
metadata-probed on August 27, 2026 but is not shipped on the deployment rail;
adding it there requires an explicit schema/catalog review, current tool probe,
capability definition, cost policy, and pricing decision.

A workspace admin can separately connect **OpenRouter** in workspace Settings.
That key is stored in the encrypted workspace connection table and resolved
only for that workspace's turn. The peer provider ID is `workspace-openrouter`,
and its products use `workspace-openrouter/<upstream>`. Curated OpenRouter
membership is available through this workspace rail even when the deployment
has no `OPENGENI_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; selectability still requires the workspace
connection and policy. These turns have `upstreamPayer: workspace` and
`metering: external`, so OpenGeni neither debits credits nor treats them as the
deployment's free/credits rail. Billing settles directly through the
workspace's OpenRouter account.

Admins may add exact OpenRouter slugs in the same card. The API does not call
OpenRouter `GET /models` or infer capabilities dynamically. Custom IDs receive
the reviewed conservative text/function-calling Chat envelope, and the admin is
asserting that the upstream slug supports that behavior. OpenGeni does not claim
a reasoning vocabulary or context-window size for these unreviewed slugs.
Duplicate and curated collisions are scoped to the OpenRouter workspace
provider, not to Vercel AI Gateway or deployment-managed `openrouter/*`.

## `list_models` agent tool

`list_models` is an always-visible, read-only local function with strict empty
arguments. It loads the current workspace catalog at execution time and uses
the same membership, connection-readiness, workspace-policy, and provider-health
decision as the human picker. Its result is one text string in catalog order:

```text
Current: gpt-6-astra
- openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free | Nemotron 3 Super 120B | free | Good for bounded tool-driven work.
- gpt-6-sol | GPT-6 Sol | credits
```

Each selectable line is `id | label | cost` with an optional final note. It
never returns keys, URLs, upstream IDs, prices, capabilities, definition
versions, or JSON. It does not switch the current session model; an agent uses
an ID with `session_create`, while humans use the model picker.

### Secret-safe definition versions

`definitionVersion` is a deterministic SHA-256 digest of executable model and
provider metadata. It changes when routing, wire API, wire profile, execution limits,
capabilities, pricing, credential class, billing attribution, base URL, or an
explicitly public request-metadata value changes.

It does not include aliases, display labels, health, entitlement state, concrete
credential IDs, keys, tokens, or secret header/query values. Rotating a secret
within the same credential class therefore does not invalidate an accepted
turn. Changing executable provider identity does.

Accepted policies also tolerate strictly additive latency-mode and input-modality
declarations. Verification reconstructs an exact historical subset digest, keeping
the frozen runnable mode and every retained mode declaration unchanged. It never
rewrites the accepted policy or request tier. Removed modes/modalities, changed
mode support or billing multipliers, and all other executable-definition drift
remain fail-closed; this path does not compose with historical digest migrations.

Enabling hosted web search on an existing model is tolerated the same way, as a
separate exception: an accepted policy whose digest reproduces the current
definition with `capabilities.hostedTools.webSearch` set back to exactly
`{ upstream: "unknown", runnable: false }` still verifies. That turn keeps its
frozen tool set on every recovery attempt (no `web_search` is added mid-turn,
so the tool prefix and the accepted definition stay exact); the next accepted
logical turn resolves the newly enabled tool. Turning web search off, starting
from any other web-search declaration, or combining the enablement with any
other drift (including the latency/input-modality subsets) still fails closed.

Credential identity is also not a conversation-history compatibility boundary.
Changing the selected Codex or SuperGrok subscription does not rewrite canonical history or
a saved approval `RunState`. Responses providers receive canonical structured
items directly. Image-capable Chat Completions models receive attached images
and `view_image` results. Tool images are delivered in a labelled image envelope
after their paired tool results because Chat tool messages accept text only.
Assistant content omits response-only metadata on the Chat wire; canonical
history and provider cache extensions stay unchanged. Claude adaptive thinking
explicitly requests visible summaries.

The shared Chat adapter retains both `reasoning` and `reasoning_content` replies
as canonical reasoning items and forwards streamed text to the existing thinking
timeline. Request-local projection restores the original field at assistant-message
scope, alongside its answer and tool calls. Older replies with reasoning nested
inside text metadata are recovered at that boundary; output-only `tools` metadata
is omitted. Structured `reasoning_details` retain their full ordered sequence,
including signatures/encrypted blocks, through streaming, persistence and Chat
tool continuation. Only text/summary details enter the thinking timeline;
consecutive streamed text/summary fragments are assembled into logical blocks,
while opaque blocks remain separate. Explicit empty detail arrays are preserved.
Parallel plaintext aliases do not emit a duplicate delta. This behavior is
shared by configured providers and Chat BYOK routes. See the
[structured reasoning contract](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/reasoning-tokens).
When switching to Responses or native Claude, plaintext Chat reasoning becomes
labelled historical assistant text; it is not sent as an empty foreign reasoning
artifact. Responses also omits Chat reply-message metadata from text/refusal
blocks and nested Chat function envelopes from tool calls. Both adapters apply
this projection at their request boundary, including SDK-driven continuations.
Canonical history stays unchanged, so switching back
to Chat restores its original reasoning field. Native encrypted Responses and
signed Claude reasoning retain their exact artifacts on their own API. When
switching API families, their readable summaries become labelled historical
assistant text; an opaque-only item becomes an unavailable marker. Signatures
and ciphertext never enter another API's request. Chat also applies the shared
projection at its adapter boundary, covering SDK-driven continuations.
Older replies with reasoning only in nested Chat metadata retain that text too;
newer replies with a separate reasoning item do not duplicate it.

Chat Completions receives one request-local transcript view for
canonical record types that its SDK converter cannot represent; that view is
never persisted. Historical `tool_search` calls/outputs remain inert completed
facts. A session frozen to `remote_v2` compaction admits only Codex models;
portable sessions may use any supported route whose request adapter can express
their canonical history. Responses output items may carry `status`
(`completed` / `in_progress` / `incomplete`); that field is not conversation
meaning for function/message annotations — pairing is `call_id` — and Codex's input schema rejects it
(`400 Unknown parameter: 'input[N].status'`). New `session_history_items` rows
omit it at persist (`canonicalizePersistedHistoryItem`). The Codex request
normalizer still strips leftover item `id` and `status` on the wire for
already-stored SuperGrok rows and mid-turn SDK items — ordinary inference and
portable compaction share that seam — and never rewrites stored rows.
Hosted web/file search, code interpreter and image-generation calls are an
exception: their Responses replay schema requires `status`. Both persistence
and wire normalization preserve the original value, including failed or
in-progress outcomes; neither synthesizes completion. SDK `hosted_tool_call`
records retain their status and provider data as well. This preservation does
not reconstruct status already lost from historical rows or alter the SDK's
legacy missing-status conversion behavior.

SuperGrok models use the `supergrok/` product namespace and the curated
`supergrok-subscription` provider. The catalog advertises image input, which is
the worker gate for user image attachments, `view_image`, and `computer_*`
screenshot tools. The xAI API-key rail remains separate. See
[`supergrok-subscription.md`](supergrok-subscription.md) for account authority,
allocator, lease, and durable capacity-wait semantics.

## Canonicalization and compatibility

`canonicalizeConfiguredModelId` accepts a canonical ID or an explicit alias.
New session, Send, Steer, scheduled-task, child-session, and workspace-policy
admission store canonical product IDs. Alias strings are retained only as
secret-safe requested-input evidence for an explicit per-turn switch.

An agent-spawned child that omits `model`, `reasoningEffort`, or `latencyMode`
inherits those fields from the exact worker-signed calling turn. Explicit child
values still win. The fallback for legacy session-bound grants is the parent
session, never the deployment default; consequently a Codex-subscription
manager cannot silently spawn an OpenGeni-credit worker merely by omitting
`model`.

Configuration fails loud when:

- two providers declare the same canonical product ID;
- an alias collides with a canonical ID or another alias;
- a model repeats an alias;
- a registry provider collides with the built-in provider ID; or
- provider JSON, URL, credential, capability, or pricing validation fails.

Unknown model inputs do not use alias fallback and must not silently route to a
different provider. `allowedModels` and the legacy `ClientModel` fields remain
in the public client contract. The normalized fields are additive and optional
at the protocol boundary so older clients and older payloads remain parseable.

## Capabilities: support is not runnability

Every capability records both upstream evidence and current OpenGeni adapter
runnability:

```ts
type CapabilityStateV1 = {
  upstream: "supported" | "unsupported" | "unknown";
  runnable: boolean;
};
```

The catalog describes:

- reasoning efforts, default, and whether reasoning is required;
- function calling and structured output;
- hosted web search, X search, code execution, and image generation;
- input and output modalities;
- SSE, Responses WebSocket, and realtime-audio transports; and
- standard, priority, and fast latency modes.

GPT-6 Astra, Sol, and Luna (including their Codex subscription variants)
advertise runnable **Fast** mode. Fast requests set the provider service tier,
use a 2× billing multiplier, and fail the turn if the provider response omits
or downgrades that tier; OpenGeni never silently falls back to Standard. The
GPT-6 family uses the 1.05M context window. A configured GPT-5.6 id still pins
Codex's 272,000 / 258,400 / 244,800 raw / effective / auto-compact catalog.

Upstream documentation alone never makes a capability runnable. For example,
provider support for X search or Responses WebSocket remains `runnable: false`
until OpenGeni has the request, recovery, and billing contracts to use it
safely. Capability metadata also never authorizes an OpenGeni tool; tool
discovery and authorization remain independent.

Hosted image generation is runnable only for reviewed direct OpenAI Responses
models. Connected Codex and workspace Gateway routes instead expose the same
provider-neutral client tool through separate paid-operation adapters. See
[`image-generation.md`](image-generation.md).

### Native web search is a runtime capability

Provider-native `web_search` is not an MCP catalog entry and is not governed by
the session's MCP allow-list. OpenGeni attaches native search whenever the
resolved provider declares hosted web search runnable, regardless of whether
the session uses workspace defaults or an explicit/inherited MCP policy.
Changing a session's connected or OpenGeni tools therefore cannot silently
disable web search.

Models without hosted search (Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, GLM and other
registry models) can instead receive Opengeni's provider-agnostic `web_search`
and `web_fetch` function tools when the deployment configures a search
provider. Hosted search stays the default wherever it exists. See
[web search](web-search.md).

`tool_search` is a different capability: it searches bounded lazy tool
schemas (deferred MCP plus every non-MCP function tool outside the
always-visible base set) so the model can discover them without preloading
every schema. It does not search the public web and must not be presented as a
fallback for native `web_search`.

Progressive disclosure is selected explicitly per resolved provider:

- **Codex subscription — `codex_native`:** native client `tool_search`; deferred
  schemas stay off the first-request tool block. A remembered authorized name
  binds through `resolveMissingFunctionTool` without requiring another search.
- **Built-in direct OpenAI/Azure Responses — `openai_native`:** the runtime keeps
  the original tool objects available to that same hook with the SDK deferred
  gate disabled, removes lazy schemas only from the provider request, and
  returns those same objects from native client `tool_search`.
- **Other ordinary function-calling providers — `generic_dispatch`:** the model
  receives stable ordinary `tool_search` and `tool_invoke` functions. No provider
  protocol extension is required. This includes an OpenAI-compatible custom base
  URL: configuring the built-in OpenAI slot does not prove native-search support.

Classification is origin, not transport. The same first-request set is eager on
every path: the closed non-MCP allowlist (`exec_command`, `write_stdin`,
`apply_patch`, `view_image`, `skill_read`, `request_human_input`, `list_models`,
and `code_search` / provider `web_search` / `web_fetch` when enabled) plus MCP
tools whose session `ToolRef.eager` is true. Every other function tool —
deferred MCP, Browser/Computer, `generate_image`, `generate_video`,
`get_video_generation_capabilities`, and later first-party additions — is
searchable on Codex, OpenAI, and generic dispatch alike. Native hosted image
generation stays a `hosted_tool` and is not in this function-tool hide set.
`ToolRef.eager` remains a per-session MCP choice and is untouched.

The sandbox's hosted-vs-function structured-tool setting does not select any of
these modes. `OPENGENI_CODEX_TOOL_SEARCH_ENABLED` controls only Codex native
disclosure. `OPENGENI_LAZY_TOOL_SEARCH_ENABLED` independently controls the
OpenAI/Azure native and generic paths; both settings default to enabled.

The execution registry and model-visible tools are deliberately separate.
Search never grants authority: every invocation resolves against the current
turn's already-authorized tool snapshot. Generic dispatch and native transports
accept a remembered authorized name after portable compaction without requiring
a fragile disclosure ledger; a removed, revoked, or malformed target returns a
typed model-visible error (`tool_unavailable` on generic `tool_invoke`, the
SDK not-found message on native) instead of killing the turn. The compacted
textual summary is never trusted as an exact schema store. Historical
generic-dispatch calls are restored independently of the current transport, so
switching providers cannot expose OpenGeni's internal execution rewrite.

Prompt-cache stability is a primary invariant. Generic control schemas,
descriptions, and ordering are constant, so adding, removing, or changing a
deferred MCP tool does not change the request's top-level tool block. The live
DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 probe on 2026-08-07 reused 7,680 cached input tokens on
both post-search requests while completing search → invoke → final output.
Generic search results are also bounded before they enter ordinary tool-output
handling, so schema JSON is never silently middle-truncated.

The native tool uses the Agents SDK's bounded `medium` search-context setting
and preserves provider URL-citation annotations in structured conversation
history. It does not need a sandbox. If the resolved provider does not support
hosted search, or the provider search call fails, OpenGeni does not switch
providers, invoke an MCP connector, or run `curl` in a sandbox as a silent
fallback.

Existing explicit sessions are never widened automatically. An authorized
client can explicitly adopt the current workspace defaults through the
version-fenced session tool-policy endpoint; the change is audited and applies
from the next attempt:

```ts
const session = await client.getSession(workspaceId, sessionId);
await client.updateSessionToolPolicy(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  mode: "workspace_default",
  expectedVersion: session.toolPolicyVersion ?? 1,
});
```

A child may make this transition only while its immediate parent still tracks
workspace defaults. Use the original `{ tools, expectedVersion }` request when
the intent is an explicit fixed allow-list instead.

## Static catalog and workspace availability

`GET /v1/config/client` remains public bootstrap configuration. Signed-out
responses expose stably admissible deployment models, never disconnected
subscription models. Bearer or actor-epoch authenticated responses resolve the
caller's default workspace; `?workspaceId=<id>` selects an exact authorized workspace (required
for organization keys without a default). The SDK accepts this selector through
`getClientConfig({ workspaceId })`, and the embedded session proxy pins its host
workspace. A managed-browser cookie alone remains unscoped deployment bootstrap
so account/session-set reconciliation can load before scoped reads; it never
discloses a workspace model catalog.

`models` contains exactly the canonical IDs that
direct fresh session creation accepts through the shared stable admission
predicate. It rejects only absent/retired definitions, unsupported text/SSE,
workspace policy or connection model permissions, inactive/reauth-required
connections, and missing deployment API keys. Unknown, stale or unavailable
provider health (including xAI freshness) and deployment credential-resolver
observations never reject creation. Azure AD/managed identity credentials are
resolved at execution, not assumed absent when no observation exists.

Client config and omitted-model creation use the complete same default
decision, including reasoning effort. When the configured deployment default
is stably blocked, the shared decision falls back to the first admitted model
with that model's default reasoning effort. A transiently unavailable but
stably admitted deployment default is not replaced by this fallback.

Each config model carries an optional `availability` observation for degraded
UI display. Its status/reason/checkedAt and transient `selectable` flag do not
override membership in `models`: a model may remain creatable while
reported unavailable. A caller lacking `sessions:create` receives no models.
`models` is authoritative and may be empty. Normally `allowedModels` has the
same IDs; only when `models` is empty, it retains the one `defaultModel` hint so
older clients with a nonempty-list parser still load. The additive
`legacyModelFallback: { id, availability }` explicitly marks that hint
unavailable and not selectable, with its stable reason. It grants no admission;
creation still rejects it. New clients use `models`, not this legacy fallback,
for choices. Older string-list-only clients may show the unusable hint but
receive the ordinary rejection instead of failing bootstrap parsing.
Billing/usage admission and a provider's live response are separate from model
selection. Changes between listing and creating are re-evaluated at creation.
Responses contain no connected-account identity, provider secrets, or execution
topology. Child inheritance and keyed repair keep their accepted-work rules.

Authenticated callers use:

```text
GET /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-catalog
```

The route requires `workspace:read`, returns `cache-control: private, no-store`,
and adds availability to each static definition:

```ts
type ModelCredentialReadinessV1 = {
  status: "ready" | "not_ready" | "error";
  reason:
    | "missing_credential"
    | "needs_reauth"
    | "prerequisites_missing"
    | "resolver_error"
    | "observation_stale"
    | null;
  basis: "configuration" | "connection" | "resolver";
  checkedAt: string | null;
};

type ModelAvailabilityV1 = {
  status: "available" | "unavailable" | "degraded" | "unknown";
  selectable: boolean;
  reason:
    | "missing_credential"
    | "needs_reauth"
    | "credential_not_ready"
    | "not_entitled"
    | "provider_unhealthy"
    | "policy_blocked"
    | "unsupported"
    | null;
  checkedAt: string | null;
};
```

Workspace admins manage the hard allowlist from **Workspace settings → Models →
Allowed models**. The UI supports an unrestricted policy or an exact canonical model-id
allowlist, including future/custom IDs that are not yet present in the catalog.
It uses the existing model-policy routes through the typed SDK methods
`getWorkspaceModelAccessPolicy` and `updateWorkspaceModelAccessPolicy`:

```text
GET /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy
PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy
```

Provider allowlists remain part of the API contract for advanced/operator use.
The authenticated catalog exposes only a per-model `policyAllowed` verdict, not
the provider identity that produced it. During a rolling upgrade, older API
instances may omit this additive verdict; the Settings editor then preserves
the existing provider rule and disables semantic replacement until a complete
projection is available. When an existing provider allowlist is opened with a
complete projection, it remains opaque and unchanged until an admin explicitly
confirms replacement; the admin then reviews the exact model IDs before saving
the new policy.

Credential readiness and provider availability are deliberately separate.
Static API-key presence proves only local configuration readiness; it is not a
provider-health probe. Codex readiness comes from the existing metadata-only
workspace connection lookup. Azure AD bearer and future workspace/federated
credentials require a successful typed resolver observation no more than five
minutes old. Missing, malformed, error, and stale resolver observations fail
closed and make the model unselectable. Catalog output never carries a token,
client or tenant ID, account/subscription identity, credential row ID,
federation subject/assertion, or raw provider error.

Blocker precedence is deterministic: an unsupported model definition wins,
then credential readiness, then workspace policy, then provider health or
entitlement. A ready, policy-allowed model with no current typed provider-health
observation is `unknown` but selectable. Observation timestamps describe only
the blocker that is actually returned; static/policy blockers do not borrow a
provider-health timestamp.

The current API route does not yet wire an Azure credential resolver and the
runtime has no `DefaultAzureCredential` or managed-identity token acquisition.
Consequently Azure AD bearer catalog entries fail closed as not ready even when
deployment configuration contains an explicit bearer token. Implementing and
wiring authoritative acquisition/refresh/readiness is separate work; catalog
discovery must not infer it from ambient Azure configuration or skill
activation.

The SDK method is:

```ts
client.getWorkspaceModelCatalog(workspaceId);
```

The response also carries `defaultSelection` (the default for new work that
names no model, see below) and `creditsSelection` (the hypothetical default
after buying general credits; `null` when the deployment does not bill
credits). Both are `{ model, reasoningEffort, source }` and are
additive: older API instances omit them. Credit-funded models also expose
`creditFunding`: `promotional`, `general`, or `unavailable`. This describes
current funding, independently of provider availability.

## Default model for new work

The deployment default (for example the free OpenRouter model) stays in the
catalog, but it is only the last resort for new work that names no model. The
server resolves the default in `packages/core/src/default-session-model.ts`,
first match wins:

1. `workspace`: the saved workspace default (`settings.sessionDefaults`), while
   it is selectable in the workspace. Its saved reasoning is clamped to the
   highest effort the model supports today at or below it.
2. `subscription`: the first selectable connected-subscription model in
   operator catalog order (ChatGPT/Codex, then SuperGrok) with its own default
   reasoning. A deployment default that is itself a selectable subscription
   model wins inside this step.
3. `credits`: when the deployment bills credits
   (`OPENGENI_BILLING_MODE=stripe`), a model with a positive usable balance.
   General credits fund any credits-billed model; promotional credits fund
   only models in their current coverage. A new trial user therefore starts
   on a covered model. With no funded selectable model, new work falls back
   to the next step. See [promotional coverage](scoped-promotional-credits.md).
   `OPENGENI_CREDITS_DEFAULT_MODEL` (default `gpt-6-luna`) and
   `OPENGENI_CREDITS_DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT` (default `xhigh`, clamped to the
   highest effort the model supports at or below it) configure it. An explicit
   `OPENGENI_CREDITS_DEFAULT_MODEL` must name a credits-billed model in the code
   catalog or boot fails. The unset built-in value, and any value checked
   against a database catalog (edited independently of this env value), fall
   back instead: when the configured model is not selectable or has no usable
   credits, the first funded selectable credits-billed model in operator catalog
   order is used at its own default reasoning. When the deployment default is
   already a funded selectable credits-billed model, it keeps the deployment effort,
   except that it uses `OPENGENI_CREDITS_DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT` (source
   `credits`) when it is the credits default model itself, so a deployment
   whose default is `gpt-6-luna` still starts credit holders on extra high
   reasoning.
4. `deployment`: the deployment default with `OPENGENI_OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT`.

An explicit choice always wins and never passes through this resolver: a
`model` on a session create or message request, a scheduled task's
`agentConfig.model`, a child session inheriting its calling turn, or a model
the person picked in the new-chat composer. Subscription readiness uses the
same subject authority as the catalog: the authenticated caller for a direct
create, or a scheduled task's frozen SuperGrok authority snapshot and
immutable execution owner for an occurrence. It never borrows another member's
personal subscription. A frozen user-scope SuperGrok snapshot whose pool is
gone (disconnected, reconnected under a new authority generation, or its owner
left) only means SuperGrok is not ready: no SuperGrok model is selectable and
resolution falls through to credits or the deployment default instead of
failing the occurrence. The ledger is read only when it can change the answer,
and the resolver does not change billing, pricing, or credit admission.

Where it applies:

- **API, SDK, and Slack creates** without `model` stamp the resolved default
  on the session (`modelSource: "deployment"` in the turn policy). A keyed
  retry of a still-uninitialized shell keeps the model that shell persisted.
- **Scheduled tasks** without `model` resolve at each fresh occurrence, so a
  daily report created on the free model moves to a later subscription or
  credits purchase. The accepted occurrence freezes the result; retries and
  recovery never resolve again, and existing-session runs keep that session's
  model. A manual trigger's limit pre-check evaluates the same model the
  occurrence will run (the target session's model, or the resolved default).
- **New-chat drafts** carry a `modelProvided` marker. `false` follows the
  default: `GET .../new-session-draft` projects the stored row onto today's
  resolved default (the row changes only on the next save). `true` is the
  person's choice and is returned unchanged. A row written before the marker
  existed counts as following the default only when it holds exactly the
  deployment default policy (model, reasoning, and standard speed). Slack and
  other draft-reusing creates copy only a chosen model.
- **The web console** marks a picker, launch-URL, or onboarding-connect choice
  as `modelProvided: true`. A confirmed credit grant refreshes balances and
  model funding. Onboarding loads the resulting catalog and saves the funded
  default before continuing; a failed save stays retryable. The draft save response reports the
  same `modelProvided` marker a read of that row reports. Its fallback for an
  unselectable model takes the resolved default first. When a new
  organization starts with a funded credits-billed model (for example from the
  trial grant), the post-signup step shows its credit amount without promising
  particular models. The shared picker shows the current payment source and
  billing exposes promotional coverage. The workspace **Default model** setting shows the
  resolved default and its source until an admin saves one. New schedules
  follow the default and are saved without a model until someone picks one.

## Per-turn execution policy

Admission resolves the effective model and reasoning effort and persists a
strict, secret-safe policy in the logical turn's metadata:

```ts
type TurnExecutionPolicyV1 = {
  schemaVersion: 1;
  productModelId: string;
  requestedModelId: string | null;
  modelSource: "explicit" | "session" | "deployment" | "continuation";
  reasoningEffort: ReasoningEffort;
  reasoningSource: "explicit" | "session" | "deployment" | "continuation";
  providerId: string;
  upstreamModelId: string;
  wireApi: "responses" | "chat";
  credentialSource: CredentialSourceV1;
  billing: BillingAttributionV1;
  definitionVersion: string;
};
```

The metadata key is `turnExecutionPolicyV1`. Only an absent key is a legacy
turn. A present `null`, `undefined`, unknown schema version, extra field, or
otherwise malformed value fails closed. Parsing errors identify invalid paths
without reflecting untrusted values.

Create admission uses `deployment` sources for omitted values (including a
resolved subscription, credits, or saved workspace default) and `explicit`
sources for caller-supplied values. Follow-up admission uses the session's
durable model and reasoning preference when omitted. An explicit alias records
the raw requested ID but persists and executes its canonical product ID.

The same logical turn keeps the same policy across approval resume, capacity
waiting, retries, and worker recovery. A new logical turn resolves current
configuration again. Execution verifies the snapshot against the exact turn
model/reasoning and current executable definition before provider work; drift
must fail rather than silently switch provider, credential class, billing
owner, or deployment.

Audit events and idempotent receipts use a minimal projection: requested and
effective model, inheritance sources, reasoning effort, provider ID, credential
class, billing attribution, and definition version. They never include a key,
token, concrete connected credential, authorization header, or
credential-bearing URL.

## Runtime routing and billing

`packages/runtime/src/model-provider.ts` is the canonical package-private facade
for the runtime provider surface. Cohesive sibling leaves own client/transport
construction (`model-provider-client.ts`), typed failures
(`model-provider-errors.ts`), object-stage request policy
(`model-provider-request-policy.ts`), and provider-bound model construction plus
name routing (`model-provider-routing.ts`). Gateway HTTP fallback and shared
model-call detection live in `model-provider-transport.ts`. The package root
re-exports only the facade surface for compatibility; none of the leaves is a
public package subpath.

`MultiProviderModelProvider` is installed as the process default so both
in-process and sandboxed agent paths resolve the same product model. A resolved
provider-bound model is constructed with the normalized
`deployment.upstreamModelId`, not the public product ID or alias.

- `responses` providers use `OpenAIResponsesModel`.
- `chat` providers use `OpenAIChatCompletionsModel`.
- An unresolved `codex/<slug>` fails with a connection-specific error rather
  than falling through to OpenAI or Azure.
- Workspace policy is rechecked against canonical provider/product identity at
  the execution boundary.

Portable compaction is provider-independent conversation lifecycle, not a
model capability. The summarizer uses the same resolved provider and wire API
as the turn while the durable replacement algorithm remains shared.

Agent turns send `text.verbosity: "low"`, the Codex CLI default for these
models, only on the Codex subscription route, direct OpenAI Responses, and the
Azure OpenAI Responses wire (built-in or registered `wireProfile:
"azure-openai"`), and only for GPT-5-family and later models other than
`-codex` and `-chat` variants (`textVerbosityForTurn` in
`apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/tool-policy.ts`). Azure is included
because the parallel session-title request has always sent the same field with
the turn's own model on every Responses route, and Azure sessions receive
generated titles. AI Gateway, OpenRouter, SuperGrok, other OpenAI-compatible
endpoints, and chat wires keep their provider default until each is verified.
The value depends only on the route and model, never on the message: like
reasoning effort, a provider may treat it as part of the cached prompt prefix.
A compaction request built from the turn's prepared request carries the same
model settings, so the portable checkpoint summary is also requested at low
verbosity. `reasoning.summary` stays `detailed`.

Pricing is keyed by product model ID. A tiered schedule selects the greatest
`minimumInputTokens` threshold not exceeding the current input count. Billing
classification comes from the accepted policy: `external` usage must not spend
OpenGeni model credits; `opengeni_credits` usage follows configured pricing and
margin rules. Each price entry can distinguish uncached input, cache reads,
cache writes, and output through `inputMicrosPerMillionTokens`,
`cachedInputMicrosPerMillionTokens`, `cacheWriteMicrosPerMillionTokens`, and
`outputMicrosPerMillionTokens`. Cache writes fall back to the ordinary input
rate only when an older override omits the dedicated field.

The built-in schedules use a 5% OpenGeni markup (`marginBps: 500`). Insights
keeps three amounts separate for every authoritative model call:

- estimated provider USD is the upstream list price or Gateway-reported cost,
  before OpenGeni markup;
- equivalent OpenGeni credit price is the same captured rate with markup,
  including a comparison for externally billed Codex-subscription calls;
- OpenGeni credit price is the actual credits-path price and remains zero for
  externally billed calls.

GPT-5.6 Sol uses OpenAI's current promotional list price ($4 input, $0.40
cached input, $5 cache write, and $20 output per million tokens), guaranteed
through at least 2026-11-21. Its >272K-input tier applies OpenAI's 2x input and
1.5x output multipliers to the whole request. Re-run the price audit and review
the official rate before that date.

`OPENGENI_MODEL_PRICING_JSON` accepts either a flat price or a complete
`{ default, inputTokenTiers }` schedule. Use the complete schedule when an Azure
deployment uses Data Zone or another SKU whose rates differ from the built-in
Global Standard defaults. Historical facts retain the price known at call time;
they are not recomputed after an operator changes the override.

Insights comparisons use `configuredModelListPricingSchedules` and
`calculateModelListUsageCostBreakdown`. Newly reviewed GPT-6.1 Sol, Grok, and
Claude rates live only in `reviewedModelListPricing`, not debit defaults. These
project reviewed upstream rates
onto recognized Codex, SuperGrok, native Claude, and curated Gateway/OpenRouter
product routes without adding comparison-only prices to debit authority or
changing frozen execution-definition hashes, including bare built-in models.
New bare rates require a configured model on the official OpenAI API route;
custom proxies and Azure do not inherit them by matching a model name.
Registry prices and explicit
product-ID overrides still win. External metering never becomes a credit debit.

Forward fact writers may use `calculateModelListUsageCostSnapshot` with
`priceContextKnown: true` only after establishing the request's price provenance
(including geography and service tier). Its nullable `listByClassMicros`
contains integer `uncachedInput`, `cacheRead`, `cacheWrite`, and `output` costs
summing to **upstream** `providerCostMicros`, before markup. The separate
`creditCostMicros` remains an equivalent-credit comparison, not charged-class
attribution. Existing debit/totals-only helpers keep their result shapes.

Class snapshots require observed input/output/read/write counters on every
provider request. Positive native Claude writes additionally require preserved
`inputTokensDetails.cache_write_tokens_5m` and `cache_write_tokens_1h` counters
whose sum equals `cache_write_tokens`. Reviewed native default rates support
mixed TTLs; a single explicit override supports only its declared TTL, not an
inferred second price. Unknown counters, TTL, dedicated positive-class prices,
or latency modifiers produce a null split. Fractional latency scaling uses
deterministic largest-remainder rounding to preserve the total and sets
`listByClassApprox: true`. Gateway-reported scalar cost has no authoritative
class attribution and must retain a null split in the writer. Never run this
forward helper to reprice historical facts lacking captured class costs.

For explicitly approximate historical attribution, use
`allocateRecordedModelListCostByClass(settings, model, usage, recordedProviderCostMicros)`.
It returns a nullable four-class split and `listByClassApprox: true` for every
eligible allocation, including known zero. The caller supplies the stored
`estimated_provider_cost_micros`; the helper never recalculates that total,
`listMicros`, priced-call coverage, credits, or actual charges. Current reviewed
class rates are **weights only**, multiplied by observed class tokens without
per-class rounding. Integer-only BigInt largest-remainder allocation preserves
the supplied total exactly; ties resolve in uncached-input/read/write/output order.

Every input/output/read/write counter must be observed. Missing/invalid counters,
unpriced models, or unavailable positive-class rates keep the split null, even
when the recorded total is zero. Known zero/free costs can return zero classes;
zero total weights cannot explain a positive stored cost. Per-request input tiers
are used when retained; aggregate-only historical input tiers remain approximate.
Historical cache-write weights use the selected schedule's single TTL rate, not
an assertion about the original request's TTL. Reasoning remains inside observed
output, never an extra cost class. Rollups must sum only eligible class coverage
and must not present that covered portion as all priced usage. This allocation
does not relax the forward snapshot's provenance or TTL-knownness requirements.

The added Standard rates were reviewed on 2026-10-03 against
[OpenAI pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing),
[xAI model pricing](https://docs.x.ai/developers/models/grok-4.7),
[Claude pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing), and
the public [Gateway](https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/models) /
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models) catalogs. GPT-6.1 Sol uses a
5% cache-read rate and the exclusive 272K long-context boundary; native Grok
4.5–4.7 comparison schedules preserve the established inclusive 200K boundary.
Gateway's separate greater-than-200K schedule must not replace the native one.
The reviewed native Claude models have no
long-context premium. Claude 1-hour native cache writes use 2x base input,
rather than the normal 5-minute 1.25x rate. The curated OpenRouter free variant
has an explicit zero list price, not an unknown price.

Unknown future models, alternate/custom endpoints, unpinned Gateway custom
routes, and Azure SKU-specific rates are not inferred from similar names. Use
an exact provider-reported cost or an explicit reviewed operator price for
these cases. This audit is bounded to the supported code catalog and reviewed
native profiles; it does not read or mutate a deployed catalog or reprice old
usage facts.

### Price audit (llm-prices canary)

OpenGeni debit authority is the unchanged hand-maintained `defaultModelPricing`
map in `packages/config/src/index.ts` (plus registry /
`OPENGENI_MODEL_PRICING_JSON` overrides). New comparison-only rates live in
`reviewedModelListPricing` and reach callers only through provider-gated list
resolution. The canary inspects both tables without promoting comparison rates
to debit authority. Do not generate either map from an external feed.

When you add a billed model or want to verify list rates are still current:

```bash
bun run check:model-pricing
```

That fetches [llm-prices.com](https://www.llm-prices.com/current-v1.json) and
compares Standard short- and long-context rates for the allow-listed GPT-6.1,
GPT-6, and GPT-5.6 product ids. Treat mismatches as a prompt to re-check OpenAI (or the provider)
and update `defaultModelPricing` — not as automatic truth to import.

Not covered by the llm-prices canary: cache-write rates, Azure SKU-specific
overrides, Fast/priority multipliers, Fireworks GLM defaults, the provider-pinned
Gateway snapshots, and the `marginBps` markup.
Gateway catalogue tests pin the exact Baseten/Wafer rates and caching claims;
offline llm-prices coverage uses
`scripts/fixtures/llm-prices-current-v1.sample.json`.

## Evidence-bounded Grok 4.5 support

Grok 4.5 is supported only as an explicitly configured deployment through
xAI's official API:

```text
product model:  xai/grok-4.5
alias:          grok-4.5
provider:       xai
upstream model: grok-4.5
base URL:       https://api.x.ai/v1
wire API:       responses
credential:     deployment API key
billing:        deployment / OpenGeni credits
context:        500,000 tokens
```

The evidence-backed definition exposes reasoning (`low`, `medium`, `high`,
default `high`, required), function calling, structured output, text/image
input, text output, hosted web search, and SSE as runnable. X search, code
execution, Responses WebSocket, and priority service remain non-runnable until
their OpenGeni contracts exist. Realtime audio is unsupported for this model.

Standard pricing below 200,000 input tokens is $2/M input, $0.30/M cached input,
and $6/M output. At 200,000 or more input tokens it is $4/M input, $0.60/M
cached input, and $12/M output.

Source support does not make Grok visible by default. The host must configure
the xAI registry provider and an authorized API key. No authorized xAI
credential was available during this implementation, so tests prove parsing,
routing, catalog projection, capability gating, and the exact 199,999/200,000
pricing boundary—not live entitlement or production inference.

Cursor model availability is not a raw xAI credential path. Cursor Cloud
Agents and its SDK are a separate agent-runtime integration with Cursor-owned
credentials and billing; Cursor subscription capacity is not modeled as an
xAI/OpenAI inference credential.

## Verification

Provider architecture changes should run, at minimum:

```bash
bun test packages/contracts/test/contracts.test.ts
bun test packages/config/test/model-providers.test.ts
bun test packages/runtime/test/model-providers.test.ts
bun test apps/api/test/model-catalog.test.ts
bun test packages/sdk/test/client-coverage.test.ts packages/sdk/test/contract-parity.test.ts
bun run check:docs-refs
```

Run the package-local typechecks for every affected package and the workspace
typecheck before release. Database-backed policy persistence tests require the
repository PostgreSQL test database. Live provider checks require an
already-authorized credential and must keep secrets out of logs and fixtures.

## Ownership boundaries

- The provider architecture owns normalized product/provider/deployment
  identity, credential and billing classification, capability metadata,
  availability projection, and the per-turn policy snapshot.
- Codex subscription account selection, leases, token refresh, allocator
  eligibility, capacity waiting, and portable compaction mechanics remain in
  their dedicated lifecycle/capacity owners.
- Health scoring and fleet pressure are observations consumed by the catalog,
  not computed here.
- Tool capability metadata never grants or discovers tools.

## Native Claude Messages

Workspace and organization Models support **Anthropic API** keys and **Claude subscription**
sign-in as separate connections. **Sign in to Claude** opens Claude's approval page;
paste its authorization code back into OpenGeni. This grants model and profile
access, enables direct usage checks and reset times, and stores an encrypted refresh
token for automatic renewal. Account files and terminal commands are not needed.
**Sign in again** reconnects through the same flow while retaining native access policy.
The disclosed **Use a setup token** option accepts `claude setup-token` credentials,
which allow model calls but cannot query current usage or renew automatically.
Replace expired or revoked setup tokens through the connection's actions menu. Named
Opus/Sonnet choices add models without requiring model IDs; other IDs remain
available under the model disclosure. Workspace setup creates a workspace-owned connection;
organization setup creates a separate connection for shared workspaces. The two
scopes never borrow or overwrite each other’s credentials. Both use existing encrypted
connection storage and model access policy. Add exact upstream
model IDs to each connection; connecting alone does not validate model entitlement
or make a paid model call. Subscription usage consumes the connected plan's limits;
API-key usage is billed by Anthropic. Neither uses OpenGeni credits.

The `anthropic-messages` protocol is implemented by
`packages/runtime/src/anthropic-messages.ts`, through the existing Agents SDK
model interface and instrumented transport. It posts full projected history to
`/v1/messages`, without remote conversation or thread state. Tool calls/results,
parallel calls, images, streaming text, signed thinking and redacted thinking are
preserved. Initial system/developer history items join the top-level system field
in order; later system items keep their conversation position. Tool names unsupported on the wire receive stable reversible names.
Native OpenAI hosted tools and opaque compaction tokens are not compatible;
ordinary function tools and OpenGeni's text compaction remain available.

Native Claude HTTP and SSE errors retain status and bounded retry/request
metadata. Documented tier-spend proof and configured-spend HTTP 400 prefixes
become terminal quota; ordinary throttling remains recoverable. General billing
refusals remain terminal payment errors and do not imply exhausted credits. An unrecognized
SSE error type has no synthetic HTTP status and grants no automatic recovery.
Only the provider error envelope's type/message is retained as UTF-8-bounded
4 KiB `turn.failed.detail`, with a bounded request ID. Outgoing requests, echoed
request fields, arbitrary body fields and headers are excluded; generic exception
text and serialization remain structural.

Claude subscription connections require `OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED=true`;
the deployment default is off. Anthropic API-key connections are independent of
this flag. When off, subscription setup endpoints and catalog/credential resolution
are disabled, and subscription setup is hidden from model settings. Stored credentials
are retained. Anthropic API keys, Codex, SuperGrok, OpenRouter and Vercel are unchanged.

Workspace Claude custom models use `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-providers/
:providerKind/custom-models` (`anthropic` or `claude_subscription`) and the shared subscription account APIs for Claude. Anthropic API keys keep the
workspace connection create/rotate/revoke API. Model IDs are scoped under
`workspace-anthropic/` and `workspace-claude-subscription/`; organization models use
`organization-anthropic/` and `organization-claude-subscription/`. Custom models use
immutable generations: retiring one prevents fresh selection while preserving
accepted execution history. Connection/model allowlists still govern execution.
Workspace API-key credential rotation and disconnect/reconnect preserve the
previous connection's model access policy, including deny-all restrictions and
its policy revision. Credential management does not grant permission to reset
administrator-owned access rules.

Registry providers can set `anthropic.auth` (`api-key` or `oauth`), `cacheTtl`
(`5m`, `1h`, or `off`), `maxOutputTokens`, and `streamIdleTimeoutMs`. API keys use
`x-api-key`; subscription tokens use Bearer authentication and the OAuth beta.
Up to four cache breakpoints cover tools, instructions, the prefix before the
latest assistant reply, and current history. The previous prefix remains directly
addressable when a large tool batch exceeds the server's 20-block lookback.
Signed thinking is never marked; canonical history is unchanged. One TTL applies
to every marker: mixed TTLs and `scope: global` are not implemented. This is not
a guarantee of a hit: prefix changes, expiration and minimum cache sizes still apply.
Inline Claude images use a request-only raster projection with both dimensions
bounded to 2,000 pixels from their first use. The bound does not depend on image
count, so crossing the many-image threshold never changes an older image's cached
representation. Images within both dimension and encoded-byte limits remain
byte-identical. Resized images preserve orientation and aspect ratio, use lossless
PNG when it fits both the original byte size and the 10 MiB encoded limit, and
otherwise use WebP with deterministic quality steps. Image payloads never grow.
Dimension notes describe the transport image; coordinate tools must also account
for any provider-side resizing. Original uploads, retained artifacts and canonical
history stay unchanged. Replays produce
the same projection; URL images keep their existing provider-managed behavior.
Usage includes fresh input, cache reads, cache writes and output. Per-response SDK
usage preserves reported 5-minute and 1-hour creation counts separately; downstream
durable telemetry and UI currently show aggregate writes. Registry pricing has one
cache-write rate, which must match its configured TTL (do not use a 5-minute write
price with `cacheTtl: "1h"`). Managed connections use 5-minute caching and external
billing; OpenGeni does not debit these tokens as credits.
Managed Claude connections use per-model native profiles from
`claudeNativeModelProfile` in `packages/config/src/index.ts`. Opus and Sonnet 5.5
expose low, medium, high, xhigh and max, with medium as the new-selection default.
Supported adaptive models use a 1M context window, 872k safe input, 800k compaction
threshold and up to 128k output; the native request includes the 1M-context beta.
Smaller models retain their own output ceiling. Unknown IDs keep conservative
200k context / 168k input / 150k compaction / 32k output and no adaptive thinking.
Registry providers can explicitly declare additional verified model capabilities
and lower request defaults. Native xhigh is never silently downgraded to high;
unsupported effort on a known adaptive model is rejected before network I/O.
Historical models requiring fixed thinking budgets are not enabled through
adaptive-thinking controls. Invalid streams fail closed, incomplete tools
are never executed, and truncated compaction summaries are rejected. The adapter
does not silently retry failed requests or rotate credentials.
HTTP error details are read for at most 5 seconds (or the shorter configured
stream idle timeout) and 64 KiB. A stalled or broken diagnostic body does not
hide the HTTP status, request ID or Retry-After header; caller cancellation
interrupts the read.

HTTP and SSE permission failures remain access errors, separate from expired
credentials. A provider `model_access_suspended` rejection reports the validated
UTC suspension deadline when present and stops automatic retry; reconnecting
does not lift a provider suspension. Native `stop_reason: "refusal"` is a terminal
policy rejection even when HTTP is 200 and content is empty. It uses the existing
policy-refusal presentation, never completes an empty successful response, and
never executes tools from refused output. These failures retain the request ID
without persisting arbitrary provider explanation text.


### Claude subscription request identity

OAuth requests use the pinned Claude Code 2.1.285 / Agent SDK 0.3.276 profile in
`packages/runtime/src/claude-code-identity.ts`: `beta=true`, CLI user-agent,
Stainless SDK 0.127.0, macOS/arm64 and Node v26.3.0 headers, `x-app: cli`, and
the captured v2d dispatch selector. These are compatibility headers, not a
statement about the actual worker runtime. API-key requests do not use this profile.

Subscription setup creates a stable installation device ID and uses an empty
account UUID, the fallback used by Claude Code for inference-only setup tokens.
Both are encrypted with the token; API reads return neither. Existing explicit
account/device bundles remain supported. Registry OAuth providers supply the
same fields through `anthropic.identity`. Never hardcode a user's account IDs into source or borrow
another connection's identity. The worker passes its stable session cache key to
native Claude, preserving session identity across turns and activity retries;
prompt IDs persist through the run's tool loop and client request IDs are fresh.

Billing attribution is a system text block. Its `cc_version` suffix follows the
locally inspected 2.1.285 fingerprint calculation; previous request and prompt
IDs describe this request sequence. **The `cch` checksum is not implemented:** its
algorithm has not been verified. No captured checksum is replayed. A single
user-approved nonstreaming Opus 5.5 probe on 2026-09-30 returned HTTP 200 and the
requested text with this profile and no `cch`. Omission therefore did not prevent
that request; this does not establish a universal requirement or the cause of
the earlier HTTP 429. The profile is not a byte-exact reproduction. Separately,
98 completed captured response streams passed offline adapter replay. A user-requested
full local OpenGeni session subsequently completed an SSB population chart with
streaming tool loops, signed thinking, cache reads/writes, and retained PNG/SVG/CSV
artifacts using this profile without `cch`.

The profile enables `claude-code-20250219` and `oauth-2025-04-20`. Thinking requests
also enable interleaved thinking, thinking token counts, effort, and summarized
thinking display betas. One-hour caching adds the extended cache TTL beta;
mid-conversation system messages add their existing beta. Thread, advisor,
inline-tool, context-management, global-cache-scope and fallback-credit flags
are not advertised without those features. Normal agent calls stream; title and
compaction calls remain nonstreaming. The default output ceiling remains 32k,
within the adapter's conservative context budget, rather than copying 128k from
an unrelated request. No live subscription probe is part of these tests.

Mid-conversation system blocks must follow a user and precede an assistant (or
end the request). The adapter groups retained system inputs at that boundary
within each assistant-delimited phase, including after portable compaction;
canonical roles and exact content remain unchanged.

Machine-only system phases after an assistant receive a request-local user-role
transport anchor identifying machine origin and the absence of human input.
It adds no durable history, human intent or authority; system content remains
system-role and stays after the same assistant. Tool pairing still validates
before projection.

HTTP and SSE failures retain
only the provider error envelope's type/message in a UTF-8-bounded 4 KiB
`turn.failed.detail`, plus the bounded provider request ID. Malformed/non-JSON
bodies expose status only. Outgoing requests, arbitrary body fields and headers
are not diagnostics; generic exception text and serialization remain structural.

### Claude subscription usage

Model responses, including quota errors, report observed 5-hour, weekly and optional
model-specific usage windows. The worker saves these through the existing connection
RLS boundary, fenced against credential replacement, without changing credential or
admission versions. Settings reuse the shared usage meters, reset times and refresh
controls. Past reset times invalidate the displayed balance until Claude reports
another reading; missing windows are never shown as zero usage.

Setup tokens have `user:inference` scope. The separate `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint
requires `user:profile`, so inference-only tokens update their readings through model
responses. Browser sign-in requests `user:inference user:profile` using the installed
Claude Code OAuth client and PKCE. Manual refresh reads that endpoint without making model calls; a scope
error retains the readings and disables further unsupported refreshes until the
credential is replaced. Browser sign-in credentials can refresh usage directly.
A read-only quota check runs after sign-in so the connection initially shows
provider readings when available.

Sign-in attempts reuse encrypted, expiring OAuth pending states. They bind the exact
human, browser session, scope and current connection generation. The one-use code
is spent once; a committed connection has a secret-free, generation-fenced replay
receipt. Authority is freshly checked after exchange, before individual account writes.
Organization attempts require organization administration and are not readable from
a shared workspace's runtime scope.

`packages/db/src/claude-subscription-account-tokens.ts` resolves the selected account;
shared subscription repositories serialize renewal across replicas,
re-reads the captured generation and writes only encrypted token material. Renewal
keeps connection identity, admission/credential generations, access policy and usage
cache. Each physical Claude model request resolves its original binding before
dispatch, including title and compaction requests; replacement credentials are never
lent to an older turn. Missing, disconnected or replaced bindings stop dispatch;
the previously captured token is never used as a fallback. Claude supports multiple independent accounts in workspace, organization and
explicit private user pools. Account rows, naming, primary selection, rotation
settings and access policy reuse the Codex/SuperGrok settings experience. Browser
sign-in discovers the provider account UUID, email and plan; setup tokens remain
inference-only and do not expose profile details. Replacing a token targets one
exact account generation and preserves its access policy.

The worker reuses SuperGrok's scoped account selection, credential leases and
durable same-turn capacity wait/resume protocol. Quotas and cooldowns apply to
the exact upstream model: an Opus restriction need not block Sonnet. A manual
pin or primary-only pool never silently borrows another subscription. Typed
401 authentication failures permit one serialized rejected-token renewal per
account generation on the accepted turn; persistent authentication failures
require reconnect. Typed 429 refusals record the exact response/token/model
and wait or select another permitted account. Permission, suspension, safety,
validation and ambiguous transport errors never rotate the pool. Tool results
and conversation history remain on the same accepted logical turn.
Catalog loading is offline, so Claude renewal failures do not
block turns using another provider. Invalid refresh grants require sign-in again;
transient failures retain credentials and existing usage readings.

Cached usage reads are available to workspace readers; live refresh requires
connection-management permission. Organization usage follows the existing
organization provider administration boundary. Credentials and identities are
never returned in usage responses.
